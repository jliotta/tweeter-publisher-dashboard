# tweeter-publisher-dashboard

Tweeter is a back-end, service-oriented clone of Twitter designed to determine when a publisher should tweet in order to maximize engagement with their followers. This service, the Publisher Dashboard, is designed to show the publisher the most update to date engagement metrics for their most recent tweets. On a technical level, this service has two purposes: 1) to quickly processes metric messages from Amazon SQS and update the database and 2) preserve and process this engagement information before sending it off to the long-term analytics service.
